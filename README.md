# Perspectives Legacy and 2.0 media, content, and resources

This is all **very much a work-in-progress**. We are trying to migrate our marketing and promotion material from Google Drive, Box, and misc other locations to github so that it is freely available for anyone to use.

It's currently being thrown together because someone asked for some HD versions of our made-for-more campaign in order to host an event at a large social media company's headquarters in CA (way to go girl - you're awesome).

Please see the [Perspectives Style Guide](/src/Perspectives_Style_Guide.pdf) before using any of these resources.
